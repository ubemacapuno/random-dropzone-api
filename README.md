# Random DropZone API (COD - Warzone): 
# Visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/corey-damocles/pen/RwQdeWG">Front-End App on codepen.io</a>!

This API randomly generates map locations for the videogame, Call of Duty: Warzone where players can land and start their Battle Royale experience! The maps for these APIs are Rebirth Island and Caldera.

The API URL links used can be found hosted on Herokuapp.com <a target="_blank" href="https://random-rebirth-island-api.herokuapp.com/random">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://random-rebirth-island-api.herokuapp.com/random2">here</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

Back-end: JavaScript/Node/Express, and API hosting on Herokuapp.com

Front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

To use this repository, please be sure to install the proper packages with <strong>npm -install</strong>

## Optimizations:

As I learn more, I'd like to apply additional CRUD features (Create/Post, Read/Get, Update/Put, Delete) to make the app more interactive, incorporate a database (example: MongoDB) to store the data and objects, and also incorporate a front-end library (React or Svelte) to make a more complete application.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that Express.js abstracts a lot of the code away when developing a back-end server in Node, making the development of RESTful APIs simple.
