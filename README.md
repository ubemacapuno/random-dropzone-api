# Random DropZone API (COD - Warzone): 
# Visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/corey-damocles/pen/RwQdeWG">Front-End App on codepen.io</a>!

This API randomly generates map locations for the videogame, Call of Duty: Warzone where players can land and start their Battle Royale experience. The maps for these APIs are Rebirth Island, Caldera, and Fortune's Keep.

The API is hosted on Herokuapp.com

<i><strong>*Please Note:</strong> The server is hosted on a free Herokuapp.com account, so please allow 15-30 seconds for their dyno to respond.</i>

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

Back-end: JavaScript/Node/Express, and API hosting on Herokuapp.com

Front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

To use this repository, please be sure to install the proper packages with:

``npm -install``

Start up the server using Node with:

``node server.js``

## Optimizations:

As I learn more, I'd like to apply additional CRUD features (Create/Post, Read/Get, Update/Put, Delete) to make the app more interactive, incorporate a database (example: MongoDB) to store the data and objects, and also incorporate a front-end library (React or Svelte) to make a more complete application.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that Express.js abstracts a lot of the code away when developing a back-end server in Node, making the development of RESTful APIs simple.
